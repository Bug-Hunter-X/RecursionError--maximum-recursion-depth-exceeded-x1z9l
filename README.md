This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: RecursionError.  The `factorial.py` file contains a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number.  While it works for positive integers, it produces a `RecursionError` when a negative number is input because the recursion never terminates. The `factorialSolution.py` provides a solution to handle negative input and prevent the error.
